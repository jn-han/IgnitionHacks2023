# inteflow - IgnitionHacks 2023 Hackathon Submission

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind inteflow was born from our shared struggle with math. Despite diverse backgrounds in mathematics, we all shared a common experience of finding math to be a significant challenge. Recognizing the need for extra support our aim was to develop a tool that would make math more accessible, understandable and simplify the learning process.

## What it does
inteflow is an iOS mobile app designed to streamline your math problem-solving experience. It's your personal problem-solving companion that scans both formula and text-based math problems. Once scanned, inteflow breaks down these problems, offering detailed explanations that guide you to the solution through a chatbot. It also offers a wide range of supplementary resources, curated practice problems and textbooks to aid in reinforcing your understanding.

## How we built it
Our mobile app was built entirely through Swift and Xcode, leveraging tools such as SwiftUI, UIKit, and AVFoundation. The OpenAI API brought our chatbot to life, allowing users to interact and ask questions. For the user interface, we designed all aspects using Figma, to create a visually appealing experience.

## Challenges we ran into
The hackathon's limited timeframe presented us with the challenge of prioritizing features. Additionally, this was all of our first times working with Xcode and Swift, we had to spend time getting adjusted to a new language.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our accomplishments in developing and implementing key features. These include the successful integration of the OpenAI API, creating a fully operational camera feature, developing the homepage and designing the entire app on Figma.

## What we learned
Throughout the creation of inteflow, we learned a new programming language from scratch, how to effectively implement and integrate APIs and learned more about iOS development.

## What's next for inteflow
- Integrating the Google Cloud Vision API to scan text
- Finishing developing all UI
